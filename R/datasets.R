#' @title Artificial defoliation in cotton phenology
#'
#' @description Cotton production can be drastically reduced by attack
#'   of defoliating insects. Depending on the growth stage, the plants
#'   can recover from the caused damage and keep production not affected
#'   or can have the production reduced by low intensity defoliation. In
#'   order to study the recovery of cotton plants (\emph{Gossypium
#'   hirsutum}) in terms of production, Silva (2012) conducted a
#'   greenhouse experiment under a completely randomized design with
#'   five replicates. The experimental unity was a pot with two plants
#'   and it was recorded the number of cotton bolls at five artificial
#'   defoliation levels (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%) and five
#'   growth stages: vegetative, flower-bud, blossom, fig and cotton
#'   boll.

#' @title Soil moisture and potassium doses on soybean culture
#'
#' @description A study of potassium doses and soil moisture levels on
#'   soybean (\emph{Glicine Max}) production. The tropical soils are
#'   usually poor in potassium (K) and demand potassium fertilization
#'   when cultivated with soybean to obtain satisfactory yields. Soybean
#'   production is affected by long exposition to water deficit. As
#'   potassium is a nutrient involved in the water balance in plant, by
#'   hyphotesis, a good supply of potassium avoids to reduce
#'   production. To evaluate the effects of potassium doses and soil
#'   humidity levels on soybean production, Serafim (2012) conducted a
#'   \eqn{5\times 3} factorial experiment in a randomized complete
#'   block design with 5 replicates. Five different potassium doses (0,
#'   30, 60, 120 and 180 \eqn{\times} mg dm\eqn{^{-3}}) were applied to
#'   the soil and soil moisture levels were controlled at (37.5, 50, and
#'   62.5\%). The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse and the
#'   experimental units were pots with two plants in each.

#' @title Toxicity of nitrofen in aquatic systems
#'
#' @description Nitrofen is no longer in commercial use in the United
#'   States, having been the first pesticide to be withdrawn due to
#'   tetragenic effects (Bailer, 1994). This data set comes from an
#'   experiment to measure the reproductive toxicity of the herbicide,
#'   nitrofen, on a species of zooplankton (\emph{Ceriodaphnia
#'   dubia}). Fifty animals were randomized into batches of ten and each
#'   batch was put in a solution with a measured concentration of
#'   nitrofen (0, .8, 1.6, 2.35 and 3.10
#'   \eqn{\mu}g/100litre. Subsequently, the number of live offspring was

#' @title Annona mucosa for control of Sitophilus zeamaus
#'
#' @description New control methods are necessary for stored grain pest
#'   management programs due to both the widespread problems of
#'   insecticide-resistance populations and the increasing concerns of
#'   consumers regarding pesticide residues in food products. Ribeiro
#'   (2013) carried out an experiment to assess the bioactivity of
#'   extracts of \emph{Annona mucosa} (Annonaceae) for control
#'   \emph{Sitophilus zeamaus} (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major pest
#'   of stored maize in Brazil. Petri dishes containing 10g of corn were
#'   treated with extracts prepared with different parts of \emph{Annona
#'   mucosa} (seeds, leaves and branches) or just water (control) were
#'   completely randomized with 10 replicates. Then 20 animals adults
#'   were placed in each Petri dish and the numbers of emerged insects
#'   (progeny) after 60 days were recorded.

#'   perlite and differed in the third component: Pinus bark, Eucalyptus
