\description{
Cotton production can be drastically reduced by attack
  of defoliating insects. Depending on the growth stage, the plants
  can recover from the caused damage and keep production not affected
  or can have the production reduced by low intensity defoliation. In
  order to study the recovery of cotton plants (\emph{Gossypium
  hirsutum}) in terms of production, Silva (2012) conducted a
  greenhouse experiment under a completely randomized design with
  five replicates. The experimental unity was a pot with two plants
  and it was recorded the number of cotton bolls at five artificial
  defoliation levels (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%) and five
  growth stages: vegetative, flower-bud, blossom, fig and cotton
  boll.
